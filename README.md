An interactive, data-driven web application built with Streamlit to analyze and visualize spatial socio-economic inequality and service delivery disparities across South African municipalities. This project transforms complex public data into actionable insights for policymakers, researchers, and the public.


## üöÄ Features

*   **Interactive Dashboard**: A responsive web UI built with Streamlit for dynamic data exploration.
*   **Spatial Inequality Analysis**: Visualize key metrics like income, unemployment, and access to services across different provinces and municipalities.
*   **Composite Development Index**: A custom-built, weighted index that synthesizes multiple socio-economic factors into a single, comparable score.
*   **Temporal Trends**: Analyze how key indicators have changed over a 5-year period (2018-2022).
*   **Municipality Comparison Tool**: Use radar charts to directly compare the performance of multiple municipalities across normalized metrics.
*   **Automated Data Pipelines**: Code for (synthetic) data generation, preprocessing, and feature engineering, easily adaptable for real data sources.

## üìä Key Metrics Visualized

*   **Economic Indicators**: Median Household Income, Unemployment Rate, Gini Coefficient
*   **Service Delivery**: Access to Piped Water (%), Access to Electricity (%)
*   **Social Indicators**: Education Index, Population Density
*   **Composite Metrics**: Custom Inequality & Development Index
