## 🚀 Features

*   **Interactive Dashboard**: A responsive web UI built with Streamlit for dynamic data exploration.
*   **Spatial Inequality Analysis**: Visualize key metrics like income, unemployment, and access to services across different provinces and municipalities.
*   **Composite Development Index**: A custom-built, weighted index that synthesizes multiple socio-economic factors into a single, comparable score.
*   **Temporal Trends**: Analyze how key indicators have changed over a 5-year period (2018-2022).
*   **Municipality Comparison Tool**: Use radar charts to directly compare the performance of multiple municipalities across normalized metrics.
*   **Automated Data Pipelines**: Code for (synthetic) data generation, preprocessing, and feature engineering, easily adaptable for real data sources.

## 📊 Key Metrics Visualized

*   **Economic Indicators**: Median Household Income, Unemployment Rate, Gini Coefficient
*   **Service Delivery**: Access to Piped Water (%), Access to Electricity (%)
*   **Social Indicators**: Education Index, Population Density
*   **Composite Metrics**: Custom Inequality & Development Index

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Programming Language**: Python 3.8+
*   **Web Framework & Visualization**: `Streamlit`, `Plotly`, `Matplotlib`
*   **Data Processing & Analysis**: `Pandas`, `NumPy`
*   **Geospatial Analysis (Planned)**: `Geopandas`, `Folium`
*   **Development Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git, VS Code
